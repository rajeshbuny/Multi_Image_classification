# Multi_Image_classification
# keras
This deep learning project aims to classify the input image of its category. The image input which you give to the system will be analyzed and the predicted result will be given as output. Machine learning algorithm [Convolutional Neural Networks] is used to classify the image.

# Data
The input dataset has 4 categories. Dataset: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11YRa9p8iJ7G54--1rbfLMwsz2Aaz7I7W
